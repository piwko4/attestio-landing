            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="legal-effective">Effective Date: February 15, 2026</p>

            <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the website, content, and services provided by Attestio LLC ("Attestio," "we," "us," or "our") at <a href="https://attestio.ai">attestio.ai</a>. By accessing or using our website or services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our services.</p>

            <h2>1. Description of Services</h2>
            <p>Attestio provides information, educational resources, and AI-powered tools designed to help small defense contractors understand and work toward CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) compliance. Our current offerings include free educational content such as the CMMC Survival Guide. We are developing additional SaaS tools including gap assessments, System Security Plan generators, and remediation roadmaps.</p>

            <div class="legal-highlight">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Attestio provides compliance <em>information and tools</em>, not legal advice. Our services do not constitute legal, accounting, or professional consulting services. We are not a CMMC Third Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO), and nothing we provide should be interpreted as a guarantee of CMMC certification or assessment outcome.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>2. No Guarantee of Certification</h2>
            <p>This is important, so we want to be clear:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using Attestio's tools, guides, or resources <strong>does not guarantee</strong> that you will pass a CMMC assessment or achieve any level of certification.</li>
                <li>CMMC certification is determined solely by authorized assessment organizations (C3PAOs) and the CMMC Accreditation Body (The Cyber AB).</li>
                <li>Compliance is complex and depends on your specific environment, implementation, and many factors beyond our control.</li>
                <li>Our tools are designed to help you prepare and improve your security posture, but the ultimate responsibility for compliance lies with you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>By using our services, you agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide accurate information when submitting forms or using our tools.</li>
                <li>Use our services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</li>
                <li>Not attempt to reverse engineer, copy, or redistribute our tools, content, or proprietary materials.</li>
                <li>Not use automated systems (bots, scrapers) to access our services without our written permission.</li>
                <li>Not misrepresent your use of Attestio's tools as a substitute for professional assessment or certification.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>All content on attestio.ai — including text, graphics, logos, guides, tool outputs, software, and design — is the property of Attestio LLC and is protected by U.S. and international copyright, trademark, and intellectual property laws.</p>
            <p>You may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>View and download our free resources (like the CMMC Survival Guide) for your personal or internal business use.</li>
                <li>Share links to our content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Redistribute, resell, or republish our content or tool outputs without written permission.</li>
                <li>Remove any copyright or proprietary notices from our materials.</li>
                <li>Use our brand, logo, or name in a way that implies endorsement without permission.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Free Resources</h2>
            <p>Certain resources (such as the CMMC Survival Guide) are provided free of charge. We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue any free resources at any time without notice. Free resources are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.</p>

            <h2>6. Future Paid Services</h2>
            <p>We are developing paid SaaS tools and services. When these become available, additional terms governing pricing, payment, subscriptions, refunds, and service-level agreements will be published and will supplement these Terms. Your use of any paid services will be subject to those additional terms.</p>

            <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <div class="legal-highlight">
                <p><strong>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Attestio LLC, its founders, employees, and affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages — including but not limited to loss of contracts, revenue, data, or business opportunities — arising from your use of or inability to use our services, regardless of the theory of liability.</strong></p>
            </div>
            <p>Specifically, Attestio is not liable for:</p>

                <li>Decisions made based on information provided by our tools or content.</li>
                <li>Actions or inactions of third-party assessors, the DoD, or The Cyber AB.</li>
                <li>Security incidents or breaches, even if you used our tools as part of your compliance program.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our total aggregate liability for any claim arising from these Terms or your use of our services shall not exceed the amount you paid to Attestio in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or fifty dollars ($50), whichever is greater.</p>

            <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>Our services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, or non-infringement. We do not warrant that our services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.</p>

            <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Attestio LLC and its founders, employees, and affiliates from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of our services, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any third-party rights.</p>

            <p>In the event of any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of our services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Informal Resolution:</strong> You agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@attestio.ai">hello@attestio.ai</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating any formal proceeding.</li>
                <li><strong>Arbitration:</strong> If informal resolution fails, any dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration shall take place in the State of Wyoming, and the arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding.</li>
                <li><strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted on an individual basis and not as part of a class, consolidated, or representative action.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wyoming, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any legal proceedings not subject to arbitration shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Wyoming.</p>
